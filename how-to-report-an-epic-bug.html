So you read [How to Report a Bug](how-to-report-a-bug.html) and filed a good bug report. Unfortunately the developers weren't able to find the problem. You may have found an epic bug. Epic bugs are problems that are difficult to communicate. Describing an epic bug is a project onto itself. You may have entered into an era of despair from which there is no escape. There might still be some hope. Here are a few tips on how to report an epic bug.

## Ask for Help

Talk to other users and ask if they've been experiencing the same bug. Developers can often help narrow down where the problem could be. You are not alone.

## Start Over

Clear your browser cache, uninstall and reinstall the app, create a new account, wash your hands, burn down your house. Can you still find the bug after starting over from scratch? Try to find the shortest most specific route to reproduce the problem.

## Note External Conditions

What operating system version are you using? How strong is your connection to the internet? Is your account unique in some way? Software often works under ideal conditions. What about your situation is not ideal?

## Give Up

You may have found a problem that is beyond your present capabilities of description. Humans are tiny feeble creatures. (Nothing personal) At this point you have two options.
